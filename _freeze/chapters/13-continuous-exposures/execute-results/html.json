exposures.\nAt its heart, the workflow is the same: we fit a model where the exposure is the outcome and then use that model to weight a second outcome model.\nFor continuous exposures, linear regression is the simplest way to create propensities.\nInstead of probabilities, we use the cumulative density function.\nThen, we use this density to weight the outcome model.\n\nLet's take a look at an example.\nIn the `touringplans` data set, we have information about the posted waiting times for rides.\nWe also have a limited amount of data on the observed actual times.\nThe question we will consider is this: Do posted wait times for the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train at 8 am affect actual wait times at 9 am?\nHere's our DAG:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Proposed DAG for the relationship between posted wait in the morning at a particular park and the average wait time between 5 pm and 6 pm.](13-continuous-exposures_files/figure-html/fig-dag-avg-wait-1.png){#fig-dag-avg-wait width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn @fig-dag-avg-wait, we're assuming that our primary confounders are when the park closes, historic high temperatures, whether or not the ride has extra magic morning hours, and the ticket season.\nThis is the only minimal adjustment set in the DAG, as well.\nThe confounders precede the exposure and outcome, and (by definition) the exposure precedes the outcome.\nThe average posted wait time is, in theory, a manipulable exposure because the park could post a time different from what they expect.\nThe adjustment set\n\nThe model is similar to the binary exposure case, but we need to use linear regression, as the posted time is a continuous variable.\nSince we're not using probabilities, we'll calculate denominators for our weights from a normal density.\nWe then calculate the denominator using the `dnorm()` function, which calculates the normal density for the `exposure`, using `.fitted` as the mean and `mean(.sigma)` as the SD.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlm(\n  exposure ~ confounder_1 + confounder_2,\n  data = df\n) |>\n  augment(data = df) |>\n  mutate(\n    denominator = dnorm(exposure, .fitted, mean(.sigma, na.rm = TRUE))\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Diagnostics and stabilization\n\nContinuous exposure weights, however, are very sensitive to modeling choices.\nOne problem, in particular, is the existence of extreme weights, an issue that can also affect other types of exposures.\nWhen some observations have extreme weights, the propensities are *destabilized,* which results in wider confidence intervals.\nWe can stabilize them using the marginal distribution of the exposure.\nA common way to calculate the marginal distribution for propensity scores is to use a regression model with no predictors.\n\n::: callout-caution\nExtreme weights destabilize estimates, resulting in wider confidence intervals.\nExtreme weights can be an issue for any time of weight (including those for binary and other types of exposures) that is not bounded.\nBounded weights like the ATO (which are bounded to 0 and 1) do not have this problem, however---one of their many benefits.\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# for continuous exposures\nlm(\n  exposure ~ 1,\n  data = df\n) |>\n  augment(data = df) |>\n  transmute(\n    numerator = dnorm(exposure, .fitted, mean(.sigma, na.rm = TRUE))\n  )\n\n# for binary exposures\nglm(\n  exposure ~ 1,\n  data = df,\n  family = binomial()\n) |>\n  augment(type.predict = \"response\", data = df) |>\n  select(numerator = .fitted)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThen, rather than inverting them, we calculate the weights as `numerator / denominator`.\nLet's try it out on our posted wait times example.\nFirst, let's wrangle our data to address our question: do posted wait times at 8 affect actual weight times at 9?\nWe'll join the baseline data (all covariates and posted wait time at 8) with the outcome (average actual time).\nWe also have a lot of missingness for `wait_minutes_actual_avg`, so we'll drop unobserved values for now.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r

let's calculate our denominator model.\nWe'll fit a model using `lm()` for `wait_minutes_posted_avg` with our covariates, then use the fitted predictions of `wait_minutes_posted_avg` (`.fitted`) to calculate the density using `dnorm()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(broom)\ndenominator_model <- lm(\n  wait_minutes_posted_avg ~\n    park_close + park_extra_magic_morning +
