The direction of the arrows and the relationships of interest dictate which type of path a series of variables is.

In the fork, `x` and `y` will be associated, despite there being no arrow from `x` to `y`.\n2.  In the chain, `x` and `y` are related only through `q`.\n3.  In the collider, `x` and `y` will *not* be related.\n\nPaths that transmit association are called *open paths*.\nPaths that do not transmit association are called *closed paths*.\nForks and chains are open, while colliders are closed.\n\nSo, should we adjust for `q`?\nThat depends on the nature of the path.\nForks are confounding paths.\nBecause `q` causes both `x` and `y`, `x` and `y` will have a spurious association.\nThey both contain information from `q`, their mutual cause.\nThat mutual causal relationship makes `x` and `y` associated statistically.\nAdjusting for `q` will *block* the bias from confounding and give us the true relationship between `x` and `y`.\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Adjustment\n\nWe can use a variety of techniques to account for a variable.\nWe use the term \"adjustment\" or \"controlling for\" to refer to any technique that removes the effect of variables we're not interested in.\n:::\n\n@fig-confounder-scatter depicts this effect visually.\nHere, `x` and `y` are continuous, and by definition of the DAG, they are unrelated.\n`q`, however, causes both.\nThe unadjusted effect is biased because it includes information about the open path from `x` to `y` via `q`.\nWithin levels of `q`, however, `x` and `y` are unrelated.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Two scatterplots of the relationship between `x` and `y`.

if it is a valid instrument, we might want to consider using IV methods to estimate the effect instead.\n\n### Measurement Error and Missingness\n\nDAGs can also help us understand the bias arising from mismeasurements in the data, including the worst mismeasurement: not measuring it at all.\nWe'll cover these topics in [Chapter -@sec-missingness], but the basic idea is that by separating the actual value from the observed value, we can better understand how such biases may behave.\nHere's a basic example of a bias called *recall bias*.\nRecall bias is when the outcome influences a participant's memory of exposure, so it's a particular problem in retrospective studies where the earlier exposure is not recorded until after the outcome happens.\nAn example of when this can occur is a case-control study of cancer.\nSomeone *with* cancer may be more motivated to ruminate on their past exposures than someone *without* cancer.\nSo, their memory about a given exposure may be more refined than someone without.\nBy conditioning on the observed version of the exposure, we open up many collider paths.\nUnfortunately, there is no way to close them all.\nIf this is the case, we must investigate how severe the bias would be in practice.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nerror_dag <- dagify(\n  exposure_observed ~ exposure_real + exposure_error,\n  outcome_observed ~ outcome_real + outcome_error,\n  outcome_real ~ exposure_real,\n  exposure_error ~ outcome_real,\n  labels = c(\n    exposure_real = \"Exposure\\n(truth)\",\n    exposure_error = \"Measurement Error\\n(exposure)\",\n    exposure_observed = \"Exposure\\n(observed)\",\n    outcome_real = \"Outcome\\n(truth)\",\n    outcome_error = \"Measurement Error\\n(outcome)\",\n    outcome_observed = \"Outcome\\n(observed)\"\n  ),\n  exposure = \"exposure_real\",\n  outcome = \"outcome_real\",\n  coords = time_ordered_coords()\n)\n\nerror_dag |> \n  ggdag(text = FALSE, use_labels = \"label\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A DAG representing measurement error in observing the exposure and outcome.

things you can do for the quality of your results is to make the DAG before you conduct the study, ideally before you even collect the data.\nIf you're already working with your data, at minimum, build your DAG before doing data analysis.\nThis advice is similar in spirit to pre-registered analysis plans: declaring your assumptions ahead of time can help clarify what you need to do, reduce the risk of overfitting (e.g., determining confounders incorrectly from the data), and give you time to get feedback on your DAG.\n\nThis last benefit is significant: you should ideally democratize your DAG.\nShare it early and often with others who are experts on the data, domain, and models.\nIt's natural to create a DAG, present it to your colleagues, and realize you have missed something important.\nSometimes, you will only agree on some details of the structure.\nThat's a good thing: you know now where there is uncertainty in your DAG.\nYou can then examine the results from multiple plausible DAGs or address the uncertainty with sensitivity analyses.\n\nIf you have more than one candidate DAG, check their adjustment sets.\nIf two DAGs have overlapping adjustment sets, focus on those sets; then, you can move forward in a way that satisfies the plausible assumptions you have.\n\n### Consider your question\n\nAs we saw in @fig-podcast_dag3, some questions can be challenging to answer with certain data, while others are more approachable.\nYou should consider precisely what it is you want to estimate.\nDefining your target estimate is an important topic and the subject of [Chapter -@sec-estimands].\n\nAnother important detail about how your DAG relates to your question is the population and time.\nMany causal structures are not static over time and space.\nConsider lung cancer: the distribution of causes of lung cancer was considerably different before the spread of smoking.\nIn medieval Japan, before the spread of tobacco from the Americas centuries later, the causal structure for lung cancer would have been practically different from what it is in Japan today, both in terms of tobacco use and other factors (age of the population, etc.).\n\nThe same is true for confounders.\nEven if something *can* cause the exposure and outcome, if the prevalence of that thing is zero in the population you're analyzing, it's irrelevant to the causal question.\nIt may also be that, in some populations, it doesn't affect one of the two.\nThe reverse is also true: something might be unique to the target population.\nThe use of tobacco in North America several centuries ago was unique among the world population, even though ceremonial tobacco use was quite different from modern recreational use.\nMany changes won't happen as dramatically as across centuries, but sometimes, they do, e.g., if regulation in one country effectively eliminates the population's exposure to something.\n\n### Order nodes by time {#sec-time-ordered}\n\nAs discussed earlier, we recommend ordering your variables by time, either left-to-right or up-to-down.\nThere are two reasons for this.\nFirst, time ordering is an integral part of your assumptions.\nAfter all, something happening before another thing is a requirement for it to be a cause.\nThinking this through carefully will clarify your DAG and the variables you need to address.\n\nSecond, after a certain level of complexity, it's easier to read a DAG when arranged by time because you have to think less about that dimension; it's inherent to the layout.\nThe time ordering algorithm in ggdag automates much of this for you, although, as we saw earlier, it's sometimes helpful to give it more information about the order.\n\nA related topic is feedback loops.\nOften, we think about two things that mutually cause each other as happening in a circle, like global warming and A/C use (A/C use increases global warming, which makes it hotter, which increases A/C use, and so on).\nIt's tempting to visualize that relationship like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndagify(\n  ac_use ~ global_temp,\n  global_temp ~ ac_use,\n  labels = c(ac_use = \"A/C use\", global_temp = \"Global\\ntemperature\")\n) |> \n  ggdag(layout = \"circle\", edge_type = \"arc\", text = FALSE, use_labels = \"label\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A DAG representing the reciprocal relationship between A/C use and global temperature because of global warming. Feedback loops are useful mental shorthands to describe variables that impact each other over time compactly, but they are not true causal diagrams.](chapter-05_files/figure-html/fig-feedback-loop-1.png){#fig-feedback-loop width=432}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFrom a DAG perspective, this is a problem because of the *A* part of *DAG*: it's cyclic!\nImportantly, though, it's also not correct from a causal perspective.\nFeedback loops are a shorthand for what really happens, which is that the two variables mutually affect each other *over time*.\nCausality only goes forward in time, so it doesn't make sense to go back and forth like in @fig-feedback-loop.\n\nThe real DAG looks something like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndagify(\n  global_temp_2000 ~ ac_use_1990 + global_temp_1990,\n  ac_use_2000 ~ ac_use_1990 + global_temp_1990,\n  global_temp_2010 ~ ac_use_2000 + global_temp_2000,\n  ac_use_2010 ~ ac_use_2000 + global_temp_2000,\n  global_temp_2020 ~ ac_use_2010 + global_temp_2010,\n  ac_use_2020 ~ ac_use_2010 + global_temp_2010,\n  coords = time_ordered_coords(),\n  labels = c(\n    ac_use_1990 = \"A/C use\\n(1990)\", \n    global_temp_1990 = \"Global\\ntemperature\\n(1990)\",\n    ac_use_2000 = \"A/C use\\n(2000)\", \n    global_temp_2000 = \"Global\\ntemperature\\n(2000)\",\n    ac_use_2010 = \"A/C use\\n(2010)\", \n    global_temp_2010 = \"Global\\ntemperature\\n(2010)\",\n    ac_use_2020 = \"A/C use\\n(2020)\", \n    global_temp_2020 = \"Global\\ntemperature\\n(2020)\"\n  )\n) |> \n  ggdag(text = FALSE, use_labels = \"label\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A DAG showing the relationship between A/C use and global temperature over time. The true causal relationship in a feedback loop goes *forward*.](chapter-05_files/figure-html/fig-feedforward-1.png){#fig-feedforward width=480}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe two variables, rather than being in a feed*back* loop, are actually in a feed*forward* loop: they co-evolve over time.\nHere, we only show four discrete moments in time (the decades from 1990 to 2020), but of course, we could get much finer depending on the question and data.\n\nAs with any DAG, the proper analysis approach depends on the question.\nThe effect of A/C use in 2000 on the global temperature in 2020 produces a different adjustment set than the global temperature in 2000 on A/C use in 2020.\nSimilarly, whether we also model this change over time or just those two time points depends on the question.\nOften, these feedforward relationships require you to address *time-varying* confounding, which we'll discuss in [Chapter -@sec-longitudinal].\n\n### Consider the whole data collection process\n\nAs @fig-podcast_dag3 showed us, it's essential to consider the *way* we collected data as much as the causal structure of the question.\nConsidering the whole data collection process is particularly true if you're working with \"found\" data---a data set not intentionally collected to answer the research question.\nWe are always inherently conditioning on the data we have vs. the data we don't have.\nIf other variables influenced the data collection process in the causal structure, you need to consider the impact.\nDo you need to control for additional variables?\nDo you need to change the effect you are trying to estimate?\nCan you answer the question at all?\n\n<!-- TODO: revisit this after I've thought it through a bit more -->\n\n<!-- Let's consider an example: workers at a factory are potentially exposed to something (e.g., a carcinogenic) that may increase their risk of dying. Some workers are exposed, and some are not. The problem is that exposure *prior* to the study resulted in only those healthy enough to work being present at the start of the study. If there is another factor, say some important aspect of the worker's health, that also contributes to whether or not they are at work, we have selection bias.

In such a study, selection is determined by outcome status and any matched confounders. Selection into the study is thus a collider. Since it is inherently stratified on who is actually in the study, such data are limited in the types of causal effects they can estimate.](chapter-05_files/figure-html/fig-case-control-1.png){#fig-case-control width=432}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLuckily, this isn't wholly true.\nCase-control studies are limited in the type of causal effects they can estimate (causal odds ratios, which under some circumstances approximate causal risk ratios).\nWith careful study design and sampling, the math works out such that these estimates are still valid.\nExactly how and why case-control studies work is beyond the scope of this book, but they are a remarkably clever design.\n:::\n\n### Include variables you don't have\n\nIt's critical that you include *all* variables important to the causal structure, not just the variables you have measured in your data.\nggdag can mark variables as unmeasured (\"latent\"); it will then return only usable adjustment sets, e.g., those without the unmeasured variables.\nOf course, the best thing to do is to use DAGs to help you understand what to measure in the first place, but there are many reasons why your data might be different.\nEven data intentionally collected for the research question might not have a variable discovered to be a confounder after data collection.\n\nFor instance, if we have a DAG where `exposure` and `outcome` have a confounding pathway consisting of `confounder1` and `confounder2`, we can control for either to successfully debias the estimate:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndagify(\n  outcome ~ exposure + confounder1,\n  exposure ~ confounder2,\n  confounder2 ~ confounder1,\n  exposure = \"exposure\",\n  outcome = \"outcome\"\n) |> \n  adjustmentSets()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n{ confounder1 }\n{ confounder2 }\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThus, if just one is missing (`latent`), then we are ok:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndagify(\n  outcome ~ exposure + confounder1,\n  exposure ~ confounder2,\n  confounder2 ~ confounder1,\n  exposure = \"exposure\",\n  outcome = \"outcome\",\n  latent = \"confounder1\"\n) |> \n  adjustmentSets()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n{ confounder2 }\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBut if both are missing, there are no valid adjustment sets.\n\nWhen you don't have a variable measured, you still have a few options.\nAs mentioned above, you may be able to identify alternate adjustment sets.\nIf the missing variable is required to close all backdoor paths completely, you can and should conduct a sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of not having it.\nThis is the subject of [Chapter -@sec-sensitivity].\n\nUnder some lucky circumstances, you can also use a *proxy* confounder.\nA proxy confounder is a variable closely related to the confounder such that controlling for it controls for some of the effects of the missing variable.\nConsider an expansion of the fundamental confounding relationship where `q` has a cause, `p`, as in @fig-proxy-confounder.\nTechnically, if we don't have `q`, we can't close the backdoor path, and our effect will be biased.\nPractically, though, if `p` is highly correlated with `q`, it can serve as a method to reduce the confounding from `q`.\nYou can think of `p` as a mismeasured version of `q`; it will seldom wholly control for the bias via `q`, but it can help minimize it.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndagify(\n  y ~ x + q,\n  x ~ q,\n  q ~ p,\n  coords = time_ordered_coords()\n) |> \n  ggdag(edge_type = \"arc\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A DAG with a confounder, `q`, and a proxy confounder, `p`. The true adjustment set is `q`. Since `p` causes `q`, it contains information about `q` and can reduce the bias if we don't have `q` measured.](chapter-05_files/figure-html/fig-proxy-confounder-1.png){#fig-proxy-confounder width=432}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Saturate your DAG, then prune\n\nIn discussing @tbl-dag-properties, we mentioned *saturated* DAGs.\nThese are DAGs where all possible arrows are included based on the time ordering, e.g., every variable causes variables that come after it in time.\n\n*Not* including an arrow is a bigger assumption than including one.\nIn other words, your default should be to have an arrow from one variable to a future variable.\nThis default is counterintuitive to many people.\nHow can it be that we need to be so careful about assessing causal effects yet be so liberal in applying causal assumptions in the DAG?\nThe answer to this lies in the strength and prevalence of the cause.\nTechnically, an arrow present means that *for at least a single observation*, the prior node causes the following node.\nThe arrow similarly says nothing about the strength of the relationship.\nSo, a minuscule causal effect on a single individual justifies the presence of an arrow.\nIn practice, such a case is probably not relevant.\nThere is *effectively* no arrow.\n\nThe more significant point, though, is that you should feel confident to add an arrow.\nThe bar for justification is much lower than you think.\nInstead, it's helpful to 1) determine your time ordering, 2) saturate the DAG, and 3) prune out implausible arrows.\n\nLet's experiment by working through a saturated version of the podcast-exam DAG.\n\nFirst, the time-ordering.\nPresumably, the student's sense of humor far predates the day of the exam.\nMood in the morning, too, predates listening to the podcast or exam score, as does preparation.\nThe saturated DAG given this ordering is:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A saturated version of `podcast_dag`: variables have all possible arrows going forward to other variables over time.](chapter-05_files/figure-html/fig-podcast_dag_sat-1.png){#fig-podcast_dag_sat width=528}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere are a few new arrows here.\nHumor now causes the other two confounders, as well as exam score.\nSome of them make sense.\nSense of humor probably affects mood for some people.\nWhat about preparedness?\nThis relationship seems a little less plausible.\nSimilarly, we know that a sense of humor does not affect exam scores in this case because the grading is blinded.\nLet's prune those two.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A pruned version of @fig-podcast_dag_sat: we've removed implausible arrows from the fully saturated DAGs.](chapter-05_files/figure-html/fig-podcast_dag_pruned-1.png){#fig-podcast_dag_pruned width=528}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis DAG seems more reasonable.\nSo, was our original DAG wrong?\nThat depends on several factors.\nNotably, both DAGs produce the same adjustment set: controlling for `mood` and `prepared` will give us an unbiased effect if either DAG is correct.\nEven if the new DAG were to produce a different adjustment set, whether the result is meaningfully different depends on the strength of the confounding.\n\n### Include instruments and precision variables\n\nTechnically, you do not need to include instrumental and precision variables in your DAG.\nThe adjustment sets will be the same with and without them.\nHowever, adding them is helpful for two reasons.\nFirstly, they demonstrate your assumptions about their relationships and the variables under study.\nAs discussed above, *not* including an arrow is a more significant assumption than including one, so it's valuable information about how you think the causal structure operates.\nSecondly, it impacts your modeling decision.\nYou should always include precision variables in your model to reduce variability in your estimate so it helps you identify those.\nInstruments are also helpful to see because they may guide alternative or complementary modeling strategies, as we'll discuss in @sec-evidence.\n\n### Focus on the causal structure, then consider measurement bias\n\nAs we saw above, missingness and measurement error can be a source of bias.\nAs we'll see in [Chapter -@sec-missingness], we have several strategies to approach such a situation.\nYet, almost everything we measure is inaccurate to some degree.\nThe true DAG for the data at hand inherently conditions on the measured version of variables.\nIn that sense, your data are always subtly-wrong, a sort of unreliable narrator.\nWhen should we include this information in the DAG?\nWe recommend first focusing on the causal structure of the DAG as if you had perfectly measured each variable.\nThen, consider how mismeasurement and missingness might affect the realized data, particularly related to the exposure, outcome, and critical confounders.\nYou may prefer to present this as an alternative DAG to consider strategies for addressing the bias arising from those sources, e.g., imputation or sensitivity analyses.\nAfter all, the DAG in \\@ fig-error_dag makes you think the question is unanswerable because we have no method to close all backdoor paths.\nAs with all open paths, that depends on the severity of the bias and our ability to reckon with it.\n\n<!-- TODO: I don't quite remember what I wanted to cover here, so revisit later to add or delete -->\n\n<!-- ### Be accurate, but focus on clarity -->\n\n### Pick adjustment sets most likely to be successful\n\nOne area where measurement error is an important consideration is when picking an adjustment set.\nIn theory, if a DAG is correct, any adjustment set will work to create an unbiased result.\nIn practice, variables have different levels of quality.\nPick an adjustment set most likely to succeed because it contains accurate variables.\nSimilarly, non-minimal adjustment sets are helpful to consider because, together, several variables with measurement error along a backdoor path may be enough to minimize the practical bias resulting from that path.\n\nWhat if you don't have certain critical variables measured and thus do not have a valid adjustment set?\nIn that case, you should pick the adjustment set with the best chance of minimizing the bias from other backdoor paths.\nAll is not lost if you don't have every confounder measured: get the highest quality estimate you can, then conduct a sensitivity analysis about the unmeasured variables to understand the impact.\n\n### Use robustness checks\n\nFinally, we recommend checking your DAG for robustness.\nYou can never verify the correctness of your DAG under most conditions, but you can use the implications in your DAG to support it.\nThree types of robustness checks can be helpful depending on the circumstances.\n\n1.  **Negative controls**. These come in two flavors: negative exposure controls and negative outcome controls. The idea is to find something associated with one but not the other, e.g., the outcome but not the exposure, so there should be no effect. Since there should be no effect, you now have a measurement for how well you control for *other* effects (e.g., the difference from null). Ideally, the confounders for negative controls are similar to the research question.\n2.  **DAG-data consistency**. Negative controls are an implication of your DAG. An extension of this idea is that there are *many* such implications. Because blocking a path removes statistical dependencies from that path, you can check those assumptions in several places in your DAG.\n3.  **Alternate adjustment sets**. Adjustment sets should give roughly the same answer because, outside of random and measurement errors, they are all sets that block backdoor paths. If more than one adjustment set seems reasonable, you can use that as a sensitivity analysis by checking multiple models.\n\nWe'll discuss these in detail in [Chapter -@sec-sensitivity].\nThe caveat here is that these should be complementary to your initial DAG, not a way of *replacing* it.\nIn fact, if you use more than one adjustment set during your analysis, you should report the results from all of them to avoid overfitting your results to your data.\n",
